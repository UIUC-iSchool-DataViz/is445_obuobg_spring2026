notes:
so far, we've been covering a bit of javascript and vega-lite as some new viz engines and using them in Jekyll and Streamlit


---

## (More) This Week

<img src="../week13/images/week13.png" alt="Updated mindmap visualization of where we are in the class, now Graphics/SciViz and Rendering has been included.">

notes:

today we'll discuss a bit about how rendering 3D objects to make them look "photo realistic" works, which will give us an intro to scientific viz ...

---

## Next Week: Guest Lecture from NCSA's Advanced Visualization Lab

Special guest speaker Week 13!

notes:
... which we'll also hear more about from the AVL, i.e. the Advanced Visualization Lab which will be giving us a special guest lecture next week!

---

## Heads up: Change of Modalities Week 15 & 16

Weeks 15 & 16 will have some pre-recorded materials for the extra credit assignments (SciViz, Network Viz, Text Viz).

There will be short lectures and the rest of the time we'll have space to work on your Final Projects (as a group or in breakout groups).

notes:

we'll also "talk" more about this in Week 15 with some pre-recorded materials and an extra credit optional assignment on scientific viz

you can stay in the main room, or there will be breakout rooms for you as well!

**go over where EC assignments are!!**

---

## Today

 1. 3D Computer Graphics
   * 3D Graphics Tools
   * Visual Effects tools
 1. Intro to Scientific Visualization
 
notes: so today we're going to talk a bit about some "high-end" graphics tools  and about how rendering works, this will become more important a bit next week and in the sci viz week.  While we won't end up doing a lot of this ourselves -- we are focusing on data visualization -- the concepts will still show up from time to time to its worth covering.

We'll have a talk from someone in the Advanced Visualization Lab in Week 14 and she'll touch on this a bit more as well

**make sure you have your audio settings correct for sharing audio!**

# TOPIC 1: 3D Computer graphics

## [A fun ~2 min movie from Pixar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEzJH-JrAdw)

<iframe width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NEzJH-JrAdw?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

More in-depth [video found right here](./).
 
notes: this a fun link to see how folks from pixar describe what they do

There is another longer video from disney on the page for today, and we'll revisit it as "reading" in a few weeks when we talk about scientific viz

## 3D Computer Graphics

 * Composed of virtual 3D objects
 * Often time evolving (animated)
 * Displayed on 2D screens
 * Attempts to simulate photorealism to some extent
 
notes: note these can also be displayed on 3D screens, but the way that happens is a little different

---

## Computer Graphics Terms

 * Real-time vs Pre-Rendered graphics
 * Frames vs Timesteps

<img src="images/graphics3d/timestepframestep.gif" width="600" alt="Gif of a 'pre-rendering' test image from a documentary produced by the Advanced Visualization Lab at NCSA.  The video is 'choppy' as the frame rate of the rotated image is much shorter than the update of the simulation time steps from the data itself."/>

notes:
real-time graphics refresh the screen faster than the eye perceives, usually at least 30 times a second. Pre-rendered can take all the time in the world.

Frames are individual images that when strung together in time create the illusion of motion. They are the "timesteps" of a movie. But scientific data also have "timesteps" which may not be synchronized with the speed of the movie.

You'll notice in this GIF, the frame rate and the time step rate are different - we are zooming out quicker than we are updating the data in the images

---

## Computer Graphics Acronyms

 * VFX - visual effects
 * CGI - computer graphics imagery
 * FPS - frames per second
 * GUI - graphic user interface
 * HUD - heads up display
 
notes: you aren't required to remember any of these, but if you see them pop up, here they are

---

## Common Frame Rates

 * 24 FPS - theatrical films
 * 30 FPS - TV and specialty theaters
 * 48 FPS, 60 FPS - video games, interactive graphics, virtual reality
 * 120 FPS - really good virtual reality

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pfiHFqnPLZ4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

notes:

you can note if you try to follow the 15 or 30 FPS (frames per second) with your eye you see that it is jumpy

24 fps is considered the absolute minimum necessary frequency so that people don't perceive individual frames.

48 fps is widely considered so fast the human eye can't perceive any separation at all - but 60 fps is safer.

if you watch a TV and it seems distractingly smooth, it's probably doing frame interpolation to make 30fps content play back at 60fps.

This youtube video actually only plays at 60FPS, so the 120 ball is kind of pointless.

---

## Common Resolutions

 * 1024 x 768 - standard definition or SD (3:4)
 * 1920 x 1080 - high definition or HD (16:9)
 * 3840 x 2160 - ultra high definition or UHD or 4k (16:9)

<img src="images/graphics3d/resolutions.png" width="600" alt="A nested area chart showing different screen resolutions (starting at 4k down to Standard Definition of 480p)."/>

notes:
Often people refer to these formats as 1k or 2k or 4k in graphics, referring to the number of pixels along the horizontal axis.

While these are the most common formats today, there's a long history of a crazy variety of formats. Cinemascope had a ratio of 2.35:1 which was wider than modern wide screens. Also fun fact, it didn't have a resolution because it was film before? digital. 

---

## Common File Formats

 * Images: JPG, PNG, TIF, EXR
 * Video: MOV, MP4, AVI
 * Codec: H.264, ProRes, DNxHD

notes:
There are many more formats, but because these are either lossless or extremely space efficient, they are the most popular.

EXR in particular is special because it can store many image layers including DEEP images which store depth information.

ProRes is only available on Apple, and DNxHD is Windows

## 3D Geometry

All 3D geometry is represented as:

<div class="left">

 * Points
 
</div>

<div class="right">
	<img src="images/graphics3d/points.png" width="100%" alt="The 'test' graphics object in the Houdini special effects software, show as a three-dimensional object made up of points.">
</div>


notes: how do we represent geometry in space? one way is points...

---

## 3D Geometry

All 3D geometry is represented as:

<div class="left">

 * Points
 * Edges
 
</div>

<div class="right">
	<img src="images/graphics3d/edges.png" width="100%" alt="The 'test' graphics object in the Houdini special effects software, show as a three-dimensional object made up of points *connected* into edges such that the teapot is shown as a wireframe.">
</div>

---

## 3D Geometry

All 3D geometry is represented as:

<div class="left">

 * Points
 * Edges
 * Surfaces
 
</div>

<div class="right">
	<img src="images/graphics3d/surfaces.png" width="100%" alt="The 'test' graphics object in the Houdini special effects software, show as a three-dimensional object made up of edges *connected* into surfaces such that the teapot is shown as a surface.">
</div>


notes: we can connect these points and images to make surfaces

---

## 3D Geometry

All 3D geometry is represented as:

<div class="left">

 * Points
 * Edges
 * Surfaces
 * Volumes
 
</div>

<div class="right">
	<img src="images/graphics3d/voxels.png" width="100%" alt="The 'test' graphics object in the Houdini special effects software, show as a three-dimensional object made up of 3d-pixels or 'voxels'.">
</div>


notes: or we can give the 3D surfaces some depth and make them into shapes

here these 3D cubes are called "voxels" which are similar to 2D "pixels" but for volumes

Link: https://player.vimeo.com/video/169599296?color=949494&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0

notes:

You can convert between points, surfaces and volumes, often to really cool effects like shown - you can get some bananas permutations.

---

## 3D Geometry

Surfaces can be encoded as:

<div class="left">

 * Implicit primitives
 
</div>

<div class="right">
	<img src="images/graphics3d/primitive.png" width="100%" alt="Image of a 'primitive' type of graphical three-dimensional object (a sphere) showing the object represented as a smooth, 3D mathematical function.">
</div>


notes:
primitives are defined by mathematical functions. This sphere is defined by a center position and a radius.

---

## 3D Geometry

Surfaces can be encoded as:

<div class="left">

 * Implicit primitives
 * Polygonal Meshes
 
</div>

<div class="right">
	<img src="images/graphics3d/quadsSmall.jpg" width="100%" alt="The same spherical object, but now presented as a connected set of rectangles showing a less smooth sphere face.">
</div>


notes:
Quadrilaterals are a good way to see the flow of geometry, which artists like, but quads can bend.

---

## 3D Geometry

Surfaces can be encoded as:

<div class="left">

 * Implicit primitives
 * Polygonal Meshes
 
</div>

<div class="right">
	<img src="images/graphics3d/triangles.png" width="100%" alt="The same spherical object, but now presented as a connected set of *triangles* showing a less smooth sphere face than in the primitive representation but more smooth than when using rectangles.">
</div>


notes:
Triangles cannot bend because three points define a plane. So automatic geometry like the stuff you use in science is more often going to be triangles.

---

## 3D Geometry

Surfaces can be encoded as:

<div class="left">

 * Implicit primitives
 * Polygonal Meshes
 * NURBS or Bezier Surfaces
 
</div>

<div class="right">
	<img src="images/graphics3d/nurbs.png" width="100%" alt="A mixed mathematical and quad representation of a sphere -- while rectangles are shown, they are more easily and smoothly deformed by picking up the 'floating' nurb points surrounding the surface.">
</div>

notes:
This is a NURBS sphere. You can see the control vertices are floating off the surface. Every patch on the surface is influenced by many of the neighboring points.

Here if I wanted to deform this surface, I could pull at one of the blue points and the shape of the surface would change.

---

## 3D Geometry

Surfaces can be encoded as:

<div class="left">

 * Implicit primitives
 * Polygonal Meshes
 * NURBS or Bezier Surfaces
 * Subdivision Surfaces
 
</div>

<div class="right">
	<img src="images/graphics3d/subdivs.png" width="100%" alt="A quad representation of a sphere where the rectangle around the equator have been subdivided from their original larger rectangles.">
</div>


notes:
Subdivision surfaces are like those adaptive volumes we saw last week. You can add detail where you want it.

---

## 3D Geometry

Datasets with many fields called "attributes":

<div class="left">

 1. Transform Attributes (translate, rotate, scale)
 
</div>

<div class="right">
	<img src="images/graphics3d/xyz.gif" width="100%" alt="Gif of a donut modeled in three-dimensional shape showing various transformations (motion along x/y/z axis and rotations) as well as rotation along an axis and as well as scaling -- making the donut bigger smaller in all or in one direction (z-axis).">
</div>


notes:
These transform attributes are the same for all objects.

Recall we discussed some of these in earlier classes for 2D plots.  Same principle here.

---

## 3D Geometry

Datasets with many fields called "attributes":

<div class="left">

 1. Transform Attributes (translate, rotate, scale)
 1. Shape Attributes (radius, bumpyness, twistyness)
 
</div>

<div class="right">
	<img src="images/graphics3d/attributes.gif" width="100%" alt="Further transformations of the donut object in three-dimensional space.  First transformation is making the donut fatter or skinnier (larger/smaller donut hole), followed by deforming the surface to make it chunky, and finally twisting the donut along an axis.">
</div>


notes:
shape attributes depend totally on what the shape is.

These are something you won't really see in 2D unless you start modifying 2D shapes with some weird transforms.

## Rendering

Rendering is the process of flattening a 3-dimensional scene into a flat image.

How do photographic cameras accomplish this?

---

## Photographic Rendering

 1. White light leaves a light source like the sun

---

## Photographic Rendering

 1. White light leaves a light source like the sun
 1. The light bounces off an object like a ball or a leaf, and inherits the object's color

---

## Photographic Rendering

 1. White light leaves a light source like the sun
 1. The light bounces off an object like a ball or a leaf, and inherits the object's color
 1. Colored light arrives at the camera lens

---

## Photographic Rendering

 1. White light leaves a light source like the sun
 1. The light bounces off an object like a ball or a leaf, and inherits the object's color
 1. Colored light arrives at the camera lens
 1. The camera lens directs the light to a specific location on the CCD sensor, effectively a pixel

---

## Photographic Rendering

 1. White light leaves a light source like the sun
 1. The light bounces off an object like a ball or a leaf, and inherits the object's color
 1. Colored light arrives at the camera lens
 1. The camera lens directs the light to a specific location on the CCD sensor, effectively a pixel
 1. The camera processor stores the color of the light at the location of the pixel

---

## Photographic Rendering

 1. White light leaves a light source like the sun
 1. The light bounces off an object like a ball or a leaf, and inherits the object's color
 1. Colored light arrives at the camera lens
 1. The camera lens directs the light to a specific location on the CCD sensor, effectively a pixel
 1. The camera processor stores the color of the light at the location of the pixel

If we want to simulate this process in computer graphics software, how many light rays do we need to calculate? 

---

## Photographic Rendering

Trick question, that's WAAAAYYYYY too expensive!

Why?

The light rays that never arrive at the camera are a totally wasted calculation. They don't contribute to the final image at all.

Is there a better way?

---

## Raytracing

Raytracing does this process backwards:

 1. A light ray starts at a camera position and travels toward/through a specific image pixel
 1. The light ray bounces off objects in the scene
 1. If the bounced light arrives at a light, it is recorded as "lit"
 1. If the light ray never arrives at an object or a light, it is recorded as the background color, usually black

This way, we only calculate the path of one light ray for each pixel. It's efficient!

---

## Raytracing

Q: How does the renderer handle procedural (formula-driven) geometry?

A: Micropolygon dicing

Q: How does the renderer handle volumetric data that doesn't just "bounce"?

A: Volume ray marching

notes:
The renderer will divide interpolated or dense geometry into smaller and smaller polygons until they are smaller than the image pixel being calculated. These smaller-than-a-pixel polygons are called micropolygons.

In volume ray marching, a ray steps through a volume and accumulates opacity at regular intervals. Each interval generates a bounce to figure out lighting. Once it reaches 100% opacity, it stops ray marching.

---

## Shaders

Shaders are code that tells the renderer what something looks like. There are many types:

 1. Vertex Shaders
 1. Geometry Shaders
 1. Fragment or Pixel or Material Shaders
 1. Lens Shaders

notes:

basically, a shader tells a light ray that hits an object, "hey!" you hit something that is glass and so it should bend light like glass, or something like a leaf so it should be bumpy like a leaf

## OpenGL

Before most computers could show graphics of any kind, several companies began to compete for proprietary formats.

A company called Silicon Graphics stepped in and created an Open Source specification for computer graphics called OpenGL. 

To this day, most software graphics you see are rendered using some version of OpenGL - including the whole Mac operating system.

notes:
Many other open source projects have copied this model, such as OpenCV (computer vision), OpenCL (gpus), and OpenMP (multi-processing).

---

## WebGL

OpenGL is primarily intended for C-style programming.

WebGL implements the same set of tools for rendering through a web browser. This allows us to easily render 3D content on the internet!

---

## 3D renderers for data: [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)

Three.js is a javascript library that uses WebGL to create interactive 3D graphics that render in web browsers. 

It is meant to be more user-friendly than raw WebGL code.

notes:
again, we won't be using it in this class, but feel free to check it out on your own

---

## 3D renderers for data: SketchFab & ipyvolume

SketchFab uses WebGL to render your 3D data in a 3D viewport in a web browser. 

[SketchFab.com](https://sketchfab.com)

ipyvolume uses WebGL to render volumes to your jupyter notebook.

notes:
there are some prep notebooks on this as well, but no ipyvolume for us this semester!

---

## 3D renderers for data: deckgl

Point clouds and 3D Maps with [deckgl (pydeck) in Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/charts/st.pydeck_chart)


notes:
We also won't cover this, but feel free to check out the resources at this link!

## Scientific Visualization Tools

 * yt
 * ParaView
 * VisIt
 * VMD
 * Vapor
 
notes: there is a lot of overlap between what scientists & visual effects/special effects artists are trying to do, but their data formats are usually quite different
 
In week 15-ish, we'll look a lot at "yt" for scientific viz

---

## Visual Effects Tools

 * Blender - for developers
 * Maya - for animators
 * Houdini - for dynamics

notes: we haven't covered any viz effects tools but here are a few to be aware of
