## Final Project

There are three components, turned in the last three weeks of class.

You will have three general components:

1. Viz for Self (Due Nov 19 - individual)
1. Viz for Peers (Due Dec 3 - group)
1. Viz for Others (Due Dec 10 (for feedback), Dec 18 (final) - part group/part individual)

Be aware:
 * **NO** extensions for these assignments.
 * There is a group-submission option (sign up open, closes this week!).

note:
just some reminders about the final project

there are NO extensions available -- you can't use one of your HW extensions for these components

also, parts 2 & 3 will be in a group, however you will pick your own groups AND you can be in a group of 1 if you want
